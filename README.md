Tisp is a "Time is Space" programming language.

## Features

- Purely functional programming
- Implicit parallelism
- Asynchronous IO

## FAQ

### Is it general-purpose?

We would like to strive to make the language as general as possible.
However, Tisp's programming model may restrict its domain.
There is no proof about how general this language is so far.
